* Installing Git for Windows

If you don't really understand git, or the difference between git and github, then I'd strongly recommend watching some videos on them. Git and GitHub have a lot of capabilities, but it is very possible to get by with just understanding commits, pushes and pulls. This tutorial will not go into explaing them. That being said, they are pretty simple systems and easy enough to teach to middle school kids. Again, git and GitHub are some services that the kids will use again if they continue with programming in the future (beyond FLL).
