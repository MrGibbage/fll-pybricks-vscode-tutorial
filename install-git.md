# Installing Git for Windows

If you don't really understand git, or the difference between git and github, then I'd strongly recommend watching some videos on them. Git and GitHub have a lot of capabilities, but it is very possible to get by with just understanding commits, pushes and pulls. This tutorial will not go into explaing them. That being said, they are pretty simple systems and easy enough to teach to middle school kids. Again, git and GitHub are some services that the kids will use again if they continue with programming in the future (beyond FLL).

Navigate to https://git-scm.com/downloads. Click on "Download for Windows" on the right side in the image of the computer monitor

Feel free to make changes on the "Select Components" screen, but probably just go with the defaults

Click "Next" on the next nine screens, and then install

When done, you can exit out. No need to review the release notes, or run Git Bash.

At this point we are done installing Git for Windows. Next we will install python.
