# Visual Studio Code
We use "Visual Studio Code", or just "VS Code" (and sometimes just vscode, all one word) to edit our programs. VS Code is a programming editor that can be used for just about any programming language, and is used by millions (maybe billions) of people around the world. It is free, and developed by Microsoft. For the kids that may find themselves writing even more software in the future, they very likely will be using VS Code again for those projects. This is a great way to get started using software that they actually might be using again as they get older.

## Installing VS Code
First navigate to https://code.visualstudio.com/download. Under the windows section, use the "System Installer" option. That way the software will be installed for all users on the laptop. This will require admin access to the laptop. If there will only be one user on the laptop, or if you don't have admin access, then you could use the "User Installer". Here's a direct link to the system installer. https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=win32-x64

Each web browser is different. I'm using MicroSoft Edge, and the downloaded files appear in the upper right corner of the browser window. Many browsers you can press ctrl-J to see the downloads. Find the file you downloaded and click on it (or double-click) to run it.

You will get a "User Access Control" prompt, asking "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?". Press "Yes".


Read the user agreement, select "I accept the agreement", and click "Next"

On the next screen for "Select additional tasks", the first three are up to you, but the last two options I do suggest enabling them as I have here:

Click "Install" and wait until the installation is finished:

Click "Finish" and VS Code will start up

You should see something like this
