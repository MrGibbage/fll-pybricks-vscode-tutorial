# Clone a Repo in VS Code
To get started using VS Code as a team member (or coach) to edit/add team files in the repo, you have to first "clone" the repo. Cloning copies the existing code in the repo into a folder on your local computer. Then, as team members edit their code, they will then "push" those changes to GitHub. Then in oder for everyone to have a copy of the most current code, each team member will "pull" the updates from GitHub. Most of these steps are automated with our setup [which you can learn here](https://github.com/MrGibbage/fll-pybricks-vscode-tutorial/blob/main/configure-pybricks-vscode.md). These step do require you have the files in .vscode that I have.

Steps:
1. Copy the link to the repo
2. Clone the repo in VS code
3. Create a python virtual environment
4. Create a new python file
5. Run
