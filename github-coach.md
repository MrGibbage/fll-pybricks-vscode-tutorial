# GitHub Coach Account Setup

Really, there isn't anything special with setting up the coach's GitHub account. Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and follow the instructions for a free account. You will not need any of the "extras". Once you have your account, then create a repository (or repo) for the FLL season. Last year I named our season repo "FLL-Fall-2024-Submerged", so maybe use something like that.

The way we set our files up is we had a BaseRobot python class file named "base_robot.py". That class file had all of the parameters for the robot (tire size, wheelbase, ports where components were plugged in, etc), and all of the methods we'd need, such as gyro_drive and gyro_turn. Then each team member would write their own mission miles. You can see all of our files in our repo. But all of that will be done by the kids.

As the coach, you will need to invite the team members to act as collaborators in the repo. But to do that, they will need to have their account set up first. Then all the coach needs to do is go into the repo settings, click on "Collaborators", and then invite the team members. Once they are collaborators, they will have full access to the repo contents (you still have ownership rights).
