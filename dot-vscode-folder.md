# What is .vscode and where is it?

There is a folder in the project called .vscode (yes, it starts with a dot). While you may not always see it in the file explorer within VS Code, it is there.

What is so special about this folder is that it contains a lot of the settings for our "project" in VS Code. A project is really nothing more than a folder with files and perhaps other folders. When you open a folder in VS Code, you also open everything that is in it. At that point it becomes a project in VS Code. And that includes the .vscode folder. Since that folder is a part of the project, you can have individual "per-project" settings in VS Code. For us this probably isn't a big deal since the team members are probably not using VS Code for anything else other than FLL, but the settings are stored there anyway.

As you do a lot of the confiuration here, just remember that a lot of these settings are saved in the repository along with the team mission files. So that means everyone will have the same settings.
