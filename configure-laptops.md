The next few steps are all about making sure all of the team member laptops (including the coaches) are configured identically. So far we have loaded all of the major software, but now let's get into the details.

Our goal is to make sure all of the following components are the same on each laptop:
- Team code up to date
- VS Code extensions
- VS Code tasks
- VS Code snippets
- VS Code keyboard shortcuts
- Robot named and set as default for each team member

This table defines where the configuration is stored for each item

| Item          | Storage        | Update method |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Team code     | Github repo    | git pull      |
| Extensions    | .vscode folder | git pull      |
| Tasks         | .vscode folder | git pull      |
| Snippets      | Profile        | Manual        |
| Keybindings   | Profile        | git pull      |
