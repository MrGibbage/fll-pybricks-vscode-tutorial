# GitHub Account Setup

Really, there isn't anything special with setting up the coach's and team member's GitHub accounts. Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and follow the instructions for a free account. You will not need any of the "extras". 

Eventually the coach will need to invite the team members to act as collaborators in the repo. But to do that, they will need to have their account set up first and the coach will need to set up the repo.
