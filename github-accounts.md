# GitHub Account Setup

Really, there isn't anything special with setting up the coach's and team member's GitHub accounts. Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and follow the instructions for a free account. You will not need any of the "extras". 

Eventually the coach will need to invite the team members to act as collaborators in the repo. But to do that, they will need to have their account set up first and the coach will need to set up the repo.

Pro tip: Some schools restrict the emails that the students can receive (for instance, some schools may block emails from outside of the school). Make sure the kids use an email address that they can check while setting up the account. I asked my school's IT department to allow emails from GitHub through, which is reasonable in my opinion. GitHub is a Microsoft company, and they take personal security very seriously.
