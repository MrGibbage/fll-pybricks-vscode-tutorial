# FLL, GitHub, VS Code and pybricks

## Background and introduction
Hello,
I am Skip Morrow. I have been coaching FIRST Lego League (FLL) for over ten years in Virginia-DC (Team 24277, the Norfolk Collegiate O.A.K.S.). In 2000 we switched to Spike Primes. Before that we used EV3's and the LabView programming environment. We always struggled with code sharing and code management. When we switched to Spike Primes, the kids on the team asked if we could use python. It turns out we could. I was excited that we'd be able to share our code more easily. But the Spike software required us to use their official development software. After doing some more research, I found [pybricks]([url](https://github.com/pybricks)), an open source python alternative for lego hubs. But even pybricks is more or less set up for doing development on their website. However, there is an perfect workaround for that. All in all, I think our solution is prettu much perfect. We can use VS Code, pybricks, and of course, GitHub.

If your team is interested in using VS Code, pybricks and GitHub for FLL, then these instructions should get you going.

## What is needed
To get started, you'll need these things:
* A lego hub such as EV3 or Spike Prime. Our team uses Spike Primes, so this tutorial will be Spike Prime-focused. But I think the steps are pretty much the same for EV3s if you are using them.
* Laptop. I use Windows, but I think it will all work on a Mac. I cannot confirm.
* Software and user accounts described below. Don't worry, everything is FREE.
* A coach with ownership rights for the team repository on GitHub. The coach will invite collaborators (team members) to be able to edit the files in the repository

## Steps
1. Set Up a Coach Account on GitHub
2. Set Up a Team Member Account on GitHub
3. Install software on a laptop (coaches and team members)
   - VS Code
   - Git (for Windows)
   - Python
4. Create a GitHub repository for the season (coach)
5. Clone the repository (team member)
