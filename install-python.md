# Install Python

The last thing we need to install is Python. We will need this on coaches and team member computers. Although, that is a bit misleading. Technically, we don't "NEED" to install python on the computers. The Lego hubs have what is called "micro-python" and it is already installed on the hubs. But when we are programming with VS Code, the editor doesn't really know that we are running on micro-python. So in order for VS Code be able to offer syntax highlighting and code completion, we do need python installed on the computer. Anyway, it is free, easy to install, and gives everyone an opportunity to write other python code in the future.

Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and click on the big button to download the latest python version for Windows.

This time we will do things a little differently. We need to run the installer program as an administrator. So open the **folder** where you downloaded by clicking on the folder icon.

The Windows Explorer should open up

Right-click on the python installer program and choose "Run as Administrator" and click "Yes" on the UAC popup

Check the "For all users" checkbox and then click "Next"

Again, check the "Install Python for all users" checkbox. You can modify the installation path if you want, but I just leave it the same. Click on the Install button.

When the installation is done, we are done installing software. Next we will set up a repository and invite a team member as a collaborator
