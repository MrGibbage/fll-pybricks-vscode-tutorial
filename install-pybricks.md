# Installing pybrics on a Spike Prime

There isn't much to say here that isn't already covered at https://code.pybricks.com/ and https://pybricks.com/learn/getting-started/install-pybricks/

Look on the left side of the code editor and click on "Install Pybricks Firmware". I do have a couple of tips

- Make sure you are using a data micro usb cable. Of all the micro USB cables I have saved in my house, about half of them were for charging only. If it seems like nothing is happening, I am pretty sure you just need to try a different cable
- Make sure you follw the steps correctly to connect the robot to the laptop. You must be holding the bluetooth button down while you are pluging it in to the laptop
- Finially, you will almost certainly have to install the drivers each time you connect a different robot to your computer.
